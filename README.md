# Horus' Revenge
I and two other classmates made this game for the class "Foundations of Game Design." The game tells the story of an Ancient Egyptian figure named Horus and his fight for revenge against his father, who disowned him from the royal family. The game is completely text-based, and can be played using Twine.
